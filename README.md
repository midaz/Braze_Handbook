# The 2019 Braze Handbook 
#### Author: Dev Iyer
##### This is a handbook on how to utilize marketing automation software within a Growth team.

## Introduction 
Hello! My name is Dev (yes, that's my full name ðŸ˜‰). I entered the field of Product Growth in 2017 and had no idea what I was doing. 2.3 years and a ton of mistakes later, I've learned many useful things during my time working at SoundCloud. I'm open-sourcing this knowledge in an effort to spread it in this relatively new field. 

I'd love to hear from you! If you have any comments, feedbacks, or questions, you can email me at diyer92@gmail.com or find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devpiyer/).
